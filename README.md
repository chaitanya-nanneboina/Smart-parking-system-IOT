# Smart-parking-system-IOT
 A simple and easy task such as parking is thought as a tedious and time-consuming process due to mismanagement of parking system. Current parking systems involve huge manpower for management and requires user to search for parking space floor by floor. Such conventional systems utilize more power, along with user’s valuable time. This paper presents a Smart Parking Energy Management solution for a structured environment such as a multi-storied office parking area. The system proposes implementation of state-of-the-art Internet of Things (IoT) technology to mold with advanced Honeywell sensors and controllers to obtain a systematic parking system for users. Unoccupied vehicle parking spaces are indicated using lamps and users are guided to an empty parking space, thus eliminating need for searching for a parking space. The occupied parking spaces are virtually stored to the cloud to be accessed by central system and direct the upcoming cars to empty spaces. The automatically controlled light illuminance helps reduce energy usage. The entire system being fully automatic leads to reduced manpower involved and improves illuminance aesthetics of the parking area. This paper aims at improving user’s time value and convenience in a parking system.
